# Android Native Build Notes

Native Android work lives in:

```text
android-native/
```

Current scope is a Kotlin + Jetpack Compose shell only. It does not include Firebase, POS writes, production data, or service-account credentials.

## Toolchain installed on this machine

```text
OpenJDK 17.0.19
Android SDK command-line tools 21.0
Android platform-tools 37.0.0
Android SDK Platform 35
Android Build Tools 35.0.0
```

SDK path:

```text
/home/longnick/Android/Sdk
```

`android-native/local.properties` points Gradle at that SDK and is intentionally ignored by Git.

## Commands

```bash
cd /home/longnick/projects/xekho/android-native
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --no-daemon
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug --no-daemon
```

Debug APK:

```text
android-native/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Safety gate

Before continuing native work, keep root web regression green:

```bash
cd /home/longnick/projects/xekho
npm run check
npm test -- --runInBand
npm run build:hosting
```

Do not add Firebase/Firestore write logic until the dry-run and emulator-test phases are approved.
## Sprint 2 fake UI tabs

The native app currently renders fake/local-only MVP tabs:

- `Bàn`
- `Kho`
- `Tài chính`
- `Cài đặt`

Data is supplied by `FakeDashboardRepository`; there is still no Firebase SDK, Firestore read/write, service account, `.env`, or production POS data access in the APK.

Latest debug APK checksum after Sprint 2:
